#
# It installs the .deb with apt, the .rpm with dnf or zypper, and otherwise puts the
# AppImage in ~/.local/share/novadeck with a menu entry and a `novadeck` command. Every
# download is checked against the release's SHA256SUMS first. Running it again upgrades or
# repairs the install; installed apps update themselves after that.
#
# The release workflow replaces @REPOSITORY@ with the repository it publishes from. Two
# variables are for tests and mirrors: NOVADECK_INSTALL_BASE_URL replaces the download
# folder, and NOVADECK_INSTALL_PACKAGE_MANAGER names apt, dnf, zypper or appimage to skip
# detection. On image-based systems, where a package would need a reboot or a layered
# image, it installs the AppImage whatever package manager is there.
#
# Every definition comes before the one call on the last line, so a download that is cut
# short runs nothing.
