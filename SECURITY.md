# Security

## Report a Finding

Report security findings to the owner privately. If no private contact is listed,
ask the owner for one without sharing vulnerability details. Keep raw secrets and
exploit details out of issues and PRs.

Include the affected component, impact, and sanitized steps to reproduce.
Separate confirmed behavior from suspicion. If a credential leaks, tell the owner
promptly so it can be rotated; removing it from a file does not revoke it.

## Credentials and Data

This repository is private. Keep sensitive data out of code and shared work.
Store credentials in the project's secret store or ignored local configuration.
Use dummy values in examples and sanitized data in tests. Check logs, screenshots,
issues, PRs, and agent context before sharing them. Grant only the access a task needs.

## Security Changes

Preserve authentication, authorization, and input validation. When changing a
boundary, describe its access rules and test allowed and denied cases. Document
project-specific trust boundaries here as they emerge.
