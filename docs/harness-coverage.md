# Harness coverage

What Claude Code, Codex and Antigravity expose for each feature of the
[agent model](harness-adapters.md#agent-model), measured for step 3 of the
[harness adapters](harness-adapters.md#implementation-sequence) design. Levels use
`FeatureCoverage`: **complete** means both entering and leaving the state are
signaled, including failure and interruption; **partial** means some of it is;
**unsupported** means no usable native source exists.

Evidence:

- **Probed** means captured from a real run on 2026-09-29. Sanitized payloads are in
  `application/runner/src/harnesses/<id>/fixtures/`, and `fixtures.test.ts` checks
  the claims below that rest on them.
- **Documented** means the harness's own documentation, not yet seen in a run.

| Harness     | Version   | How it was measured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Claude Code | 2.1.285   | Probed: `claude -p`, and the interactive TUI driven in a PTY, both with every hook event registered through `--settings`. Documented: hooks, status line, agent view and monitoring references.                                                                                        |
| Codex       | 0.158.0   | Probed: `codex exec --json` and its rollout file, and the interactive TUI driven in a PTY, with hooks in a throwaway `CODEX_HOME` holding only the probe's hooks (`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`). Documented: hooks reference, generated hook and app-server schemas.              |
| Antigravity | 1.2.12–13 | Probed: `agy -p` and the interactive TUI driven in a PTY, in a scratch workspace whose `.agents/hooks.json` registered every event (the CLI updated itself to 1.2.13 between runs). Documented: the CLI's bundled `hooks.md`, the status line and title references, the CLI changelog. |

## Claude Code

**Hooks.** 33 events. In the probe:

- Every payload carries `session_id`, `transcript_path` and `cwd`.
- Every payload after the first prompt also carries `prompt_id`.
- Tool events carry `tool_use_id`.
- Events inside a subagent add `agent_id` and `agent_type`, and keep the root's `session_id`.
- Hooks run with `CLAUDE_PID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` in their environment.

`CLAUDE_PID` names the Claude Code process, which is root-instance evidence for `same-root-instance`.

**Sessions.**

- `SessionStart.source` is `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact` or `fork`.
- `clear` and `fork` mint a new session id.
- `SessionEnd.reason` is `clear`, `resume`, `logout`, `prompt_input_exit` or `other`.
- Closing the terminal (SIGHUP) fired `SessionEnd` with reason `other` (probed). A crash or SIGKILL should fire nothing (not probed), so the PTY exit remains the fallback.

**Activity.**

- `UserPromptSubmit` starts a turn.
- `Stop` ends it normally.
- `StopFailure` ends it on an API error. It carries `error` (`rate_limit`, `overloaded`, `billing_error`, …) and replaces `Stop`.
- An Esc interrupt fires no hook, not even `Stop` or `PostToolBatch` (probed with every event registered: Esc during a running Bash call). The transcript records the call's `tool_result` with `is_error` and a user record `[Request interrupted by user for tool use]`, which marks the end of the turn (probed).
- Transcript saving is off when Claude Code inherits `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`, as a process started from another Claude Code session does (probed: the TUI says so). NovaDeck's shells must not pass that variable on, or the transcript fallback disappears.
- `claude agents --json` reports `busy`, `waiting` or `idle` per session and is documented as the supported way to read state from outside. It is a polled command, not a stream.

In the probe, a background subagent's result began a second turn with its own `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop`. So a turn does not always start with the person typing.

**Attention.**

- `PermissionRequest` fires as the prompt opens. It carries `tool_name`, `tool_input` and `permission_suggestions`, but no `tool_use_id` or request id.
- `PreToolUse` fires just before it with the `tool_use_id` (probed), so the request correlates with the preceding tool call.
- Approval shows only when the tool finishes, as that call's `PostToolUse` (probed): nothing fires between the approval and the result. While an approved long command runs, the request looks pending; `claude agents --json` reporting `busy` rather than `waiting` is the only other source (documented).
- A denial by the person fires nothing, not even `Stop` or `PostToolBatch` (probed interactively with every event registered). `PermissionDenied` covers auto mode only. The transcript records the call's `tool_result` with `is_error`, the interruption and `turn_duration`, so the transcript ends the request and the turn. An approved call interrupted with Esc leaves the same records, so the outcome stays unknown.
- In print mode (`-p`), where no one can answer, the denied call is instead listed in `PostToolBatch` with its `tool_use_id` (probed).
- Questions are the `AskUserQuestion` tool. It fires `PreToolUse`, then `PermissionRequest` like any tool (probed), so the question's kind comes from `tool_name`. Its `PostToolUse` carries `tool_response.answers`, keyed by question text (probed). MCP elicitations have `Elicitation` and `ElicitationResult` with an `elicitation_id`.
- `PermissionRequest`, `Elicitation` and `PreToolUse` can answer: a later `respond`/`answer` capability has a native path.

**Actors.**

- `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` carry `agent_id` and `agent_type`, and `SubagentStop` adds `agent_transcript_path`.
- The parent's `Agent` tool call links to the child through `subagents/agent-<id>.meta.json` (`toolUseId`), an undocumented file.
- Internal agents (prompt suggestions, `/btw`) also fire `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` (documented). One probe run saw a `SubagentStop` with an empty `agent_type` and no `SubagentStart`; no fixture was kept. Ignore a stop for an agent never seen starting.
- Subagent failure or interruption has no distinct signal.

**Transcripts.**

- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<cwd slug>/<session>.jsonl`, plus `subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`.
- Records chain by `uuid`/`parentUuid`, and tool calls link by `tool_use_id`.
- Record types beyond `user`, `assistant` and `system` are internal and change between versions.
- The file is written asynchronously and may lag the hooks.

**Planning.**

- Hooks carry `permission_mode`; `plan` means planning mode. No hook fires on the mode change itself; the status line reruns on it.
- While planning, Claude Code writes the draft with the `Write` tool to `~/.claude/plans/<name>.md` (probed), so `Write` hooks on that directory are a native draft signal.
- `ExitPlanMode` asks for review: `PreToolUse` then `PermissionRequest`, both with `plan` (Markdown) and `planFilePath` in `tool_input` (probed). Its `PostToolUse` means the plan was approved.
- Rejecting the plan fires nothing, as a denial does (probed); the transcript records it the same way.

**Usage, limits, context.**

- **Transcript:** `assistant.message.usage` has input, output and cache counts. Several records can belong to one API response, so deduplicate by `requestId`.
- **Status line:** the JSON on stdin has
  - `cost.total_cost_usd` (a client-side estimate),
  - `context_window` (size, `used_percentage`, current usage),
  - `rate_limits.five_hour` and `rate_limits.seven_day`, each with `used_percentage` (0–100) and `resets_at` (epoch seconds).
- `rate_limits` appears only for subscription accounts, and only after the first response. A missing window is unknown, not zero.
- No other source carries rate limits.

## Codex

**Hooks.** 12 events: `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop` and `Interrupt`.

- Every payload carries `session_id`, `cwd` and `transcript_path` (the rollout). All but `SessionEnd` also carry `model` and `permission_mode` (probed).
- Turn-scoped events carry `turn_id`.
- Tool events carry `tool_use_id`, except `PermissionRequest`.
- Hooks run as direct children of the `codex` process (probed), so the hook's parent process identifies the Codex instance.
- The hook's environment carries no thread id (probed).
- A spawned subagent's `SubagentStart` and tool events carry its `agent_id` and its own `turn_id`, under the root's `session_id` (probed). Spawning shows as the tool `collaborationspawn_agent`.
- A plugin's hooks stay inert until the person reviews and trusts them in `/hooks`. Trust is kept against the hook definition's hash, and no hook announces the missing trust. The app-server's `hooks/list` reports it.

**Sessions.**

- `SessionStart.source` is `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact` or `fork`.
- `SessionEnd` fires on a normal end only.
- The thread id from `codex exec --json`, the rollout file name and `session_meta.id`/`session_id` are the same value, and the hook's `session_id` is that id (probed).
- `CODEX_THREAD_ID` reaches commands Codex runs, not the TUI.

**Activity.**

- `UserPromptSubmit` starts a user turn; the rollout's `task_started` covers every turn.
- `Stop` ends a turn. `Interrupt` fires with the turn's `turn_id` when Esc interrupts a running tool, with no `PostToolUse` or `Stop` after it (probed); the rollout records `turn_aborted`.
- A failed turn (usage limit, context exceeded) fires no hook and leaves no rollout record, so activity becomes unknown there.

**Attention.**

- `PermissionRequest` carries `tool_name` and `tool_input` but no id. It follows the call's `PreToolUse`, the same as for Claude Code (probed).
- Approval shows as that call's `PostToolUse` (probed). A denial (Esc) fires `Interrupt` for the turn (probed), which resolves the request and ends the turn.
- Approvals are not written to the rollout.
- `request_user_input` is a function tool, and whether it reaches `PreToolUse` needs a probe.
- `PermissionRequest` can answer `allow` or `deny`.

**Actors.**

- `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` carry `agent_id` and `agent_type`, and `SubagentStop` adds `agent_transcript_path`.
- Each subagent has its own rollout whose `session_meta.source.subagent.thread_spawn` names the parent thread.
- Internal threads (`review`, `compact`, `guardian`, `memory_consolidation`) are not the person's agents.

**Transcripts.** The rollout is JSONL at `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<time>-<thread>.jsonl`.

- Records are `session_meta`, `turn_context`, `event_msg` (`task_started`, `item_completed`, `token_count`, `task_complete`, `turn_aborted`, `context_compacted`, …), `response_item`, `token_usage_record`, `world_state` and `compacted`.
- Items appear only once completed (probed), so a running command is visible only through `PreToolUse`.
- The format is undocumented and changed recently (`history_mode`, `migrate-rollouts`).

**Planning.** Plan Mode is a collaboration mode, entered with `/plan` in the TUI. Hooks keep `permission_mode: default` in it (probed, 0.159.2). The rollout says it: each turn's `task_started` names `collaboration_mode_kind: plan`, `turn_context.collaboration_mode.mode` is `plan`, and the proposed plan is an `item_completed` event whose item is `{type: "Plan", text}` (Markdown), also wrapped in `<proposed_plan>` in the assistant's message. The `update_plan` checklist tool the binary still documents was offered to the model in neither mode.

**Agent messages.** `response_item`s of type `agent_message` carry `author` and `recipient` agent paths (`/root`, `/root/<name>`) and content of `input_text` plus `encrypted_content`. Across 2,700 local rollouts, each holds only the messages its own agent received: a subagent's from its parent (or another agent), the root's from its subagents.

**Usage, limits, context.** The rollout's `token_count` holds:

- `info.total_token_usage` (cumulative for the thread) and `info.last_token_usage` (the latest response): input, cached, cache write, output, reasoning and total tokens.
- `info.model_context_window`.
- `rate_limits.primary` and `rate_limits.secondary`, each with `used_percent` (0–100, probed), `window_minutes` and `resets_at` (epoch seconds, probed). `secondary` can be null.

Other facts:

- `token_usage_record` gives usage per response and per turn.
- No source reports a cost.
- Occupancy is estimated from the last response's input tokens over `model_context_window`.

## Antigravity

**Hooks.** Five events: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreInvocation`, `PostInvocation` and `Stop`.

- Every payload carries `conversationId`, `workspacePaths`, `transcriptPath`, `artifactDirectoryPath` and `modelName`.
- `PreToolUse` can allow, deny or ask; `PostInvocation` and `Stop` can force the loop to continue.
- Hooks run through `sh`, whose parent is the `agy` process (probed), so the hook's grandparent identifies the Antigravity instance.
- The hook's environment has `ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID` (probed). It also inherits every ancestor's variables: probed under Claude Code, it carried `CLAUDE_PID`. An environment variable therefore never proves which harness sent a report.
- Workspace hooks in `.agents/hooks.json` ran without a trust prompt in print mode; the interactive TUI asked to trust the folder first (probed).
- **A `PreToolUse` answer without a `decision` is a denial** (probed: `{}` denied every tool with "tool call denied by pre-tool hook"). An observing hook must answer `{"decision": "ask"}`, which leaves the person's own permission policy in charge; `force_ask` always shows the confirmation.

**Sessions.**

- `/clear`, `/resume` and `/fork` switch conversations inside one process. The only sign is a new `conversationId` on the next hook, from the same `agy` process (probed with `/clear`).
- Nothing marks the end of a session.

**Activity.**

- `PreInvocation` fires before each model call; `PostInvocation` fires after it.
- `Stop` ends the execution loop with `terminationReason`, `error` and `fullyIdle` (false while background tasks run). The probe saw `NO_TOOL_CALL`, where the documentation lists `model_stop`, `max_steps_exceeded` and `error`, so decoders must accept values beyond those.
- A completed tool fires `PostToolUse` with the `stepIdx` of its `PreToolUse` (probed). A failed or denied one fires no `PostToolUse`.
- Denying a confirmation fires nothing more for that turn: no `PostToolUse`, `PostInvocation` or `Stop` (probed).
- Esc fires nothing: pressed during a reply, no `PostInvocation` or `Stop` followed; pressed while an approved command ran in the foreground, no `PostToolUse` or `Stop` followed (probed). The transcript drops the cancelled steps.
- An approved command still running after about 2 s moves to the background: the turn ends with `Stop` and `fullyIdle: false` while it runs (probed).

**Attention.**

- There is no permission hook. Whether a confirmation shows depends on the person's policy, so `PreToolUse` alone does not mean one is open.
- The status line's `tool_confirmation_pending` says a confirmation dialog is open, without naming the step. With the preceding `PreToolUse`, it identifies the request.
- The confirmation offers yes, yes for this conversation, yes persisted, and no. Approval shows as `PostToolUse` for the step; a denial ends the turn silently.
- The `ask_question` tool probably shows as `PreToolUse`, pending a probe.

**Actors.** Subagents are separate conversations. Hooks do not say whether they fire for them. `conversation_summaries.db` records `parent_conversation_id` and `nesting_depth`.

**Transcripts.** Every hook names the transcript, `transcript_full.jsonl` under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/brain/<conversation>/.system_generated/logs/` (probed, 1.2.13); `transcript.jsonl` beside it holds the same records with long fields truncated. Each line is a step: `step_index`, `source` (`USER_EXPLICIT`, `MODEL`, `SYSTEM`), `type` (`USER_INPUT`, `PLANNER_RESPONSE`, `GENERIC`, `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`), `created_at`, `content`, and on a model response `thinking` and `tool_calls` (`{name, args}`, no id). A tool call's result is the `GENERIC` step as many steps on as its place in the call list, plus one: three calls made at once in step 1 got their results as steps 2, 3 and 4, a failed call included (probed). Lines are not in step order: results made at once can be written before the step that made the calls. The person's input wraps their words in `<USER_REQUEST>`, followed by context blocks (`ADDITIONAL_METADATA`, `PLAN`, …). It is said to be rewritten on compaction; not yet probed, since `/compact` in print mode reaches the model as plain text (the file was only appended to, same inode).

**Plans.** In plan mode (`--mode plan` or `/plan`) the agent writes its plan with `write_to_file` as an artifact, `implementation_plan.md` in the conversation's `brain` folder, whose `ArtifactMetadata.RequestFeedback` is true; a walkthrough after implementing does not ask for feedback. PreToolUse and PostToolUse both fire with `toolCall: {name, args}` (probed), so NovaDeck's plugin registers PostToolUse, answered with `{}`.

**Planning.** Plan mode exists (`--mode plan`, `/plan`), and the status line reports `cycle_mode`: `plan` or `accept-edits`, absent in the default mode (probed with `--mode`). Plans, task lists and walkthroughs are artifacts under `artifactDirectoryPath`. No signal marks a plan's approval.

**Usage, limits, context.** The status line only. Its JSON on stdin has:

- `agent_state` (`idle`, `thinking`, `working`, `tool_use`, `initializing`),
- `context_window` (size, used percentage, token totals),
- `quota` per model (`remaining_fraction`, `reset_time`, `reset_in_seconds`),
- `cost`, `task_count` and `pending_input_count`.

It also carries the account's `email`, which must not leave the adapter.

## Consequences for the design

1. **A status line bridge is the only route to some features.** It is the only live source for:
   - Claude Code's rate limits and context occupancy,
   - Antigravity's agent state, attention, usage, limits and context.

   A status line is a single user-level setting. For feature parity NovaDeck installs a bridge command that forwards to the person's own status line command, so their status line keeps working. For Claude Code, NovaDeck's shells can pass `--settings` at launch, as the Codex shim does for its flag, so the bridge applies only to NovaDeck's terminals. See [the design](harness-adapters.md#native-sources).

2. **Permissions have no request ids, and approval is seen only at completion.** Requests correlate with the preceding `PreToolUse`: its `tool_use_id` for Claude Code and Codex, its `stepIdx` for Antigravity. A matching `PostToolUse` means allowed, but it fires when the tool finishes, so an approved long command keeps its request looking pending. Claude Code's `claude agents --json` (`busy` versus `waiting`) and Antigravity's `tool_confirmation_pending` can close that gap; Codex exposes approval state only through its app-server.
   - A denial fires nothing in Claude Code and Antigravity. Claude Code's transcript records an interruption, which an approved call interrupted with Esc also leaves, so it ends the request without saying which.
   - A denial fires `Interrupt` in Codex.
   - Otherwise the next tool, turn or session event resolves the request with an `unknown` outcome.
3. **NovaDeck's Antigravity hook must answer `PreToolUse` with `{"decision": "ask"}`.** An empty answer denies every tool.
4. **Interruption is harness-specific.**
   - Codex fires `Interrupt`.
   - Claude Code fires nothing; its transcript records the interruption and the turn's end.
   - Antigravity fires nothing, and its transcript drops the cancelled steps. Its status line's `agent_state` returning to `idle` is the remaining signal; a probe saw it after a denied confirmation.

   Without such a source, a turn stays `working` until the next event, and coverage says so.

5. **Every harness identifies its instance through the hook's process ancestry.**
   - Claude Code sets `CLAUDE_PID`.
   - A Codex hook's parent is `codex`.
   - An Antigravity hook's grandparent, through `sh`, is `agy`.

   The hook host should report the nearest ancestor whose executable is the harness, found through its `programs`. That gives `same-root-instance` evidence for all three, so Antigravity's `conversation-observed` switching can tighten. Linux was probed; macOS and Windows need their own process lookup. Inherited environment variables cannot stand in for it.

6. **Limits are percentages, not token counts.** Every harness reports windows as a used or remaining fraction with an absolute reset instant: Claude Code and Codex in epoch seconds, Antigravity as a time. None reports the limit itself, so the telemetry model stores fractions and never derives token amounts.
7. **Codex hook trust is a separate readiness state.** A connected Codex with untrusted hooks reports nothing. Detecting that needs the app-server's `hooks/list`, not a hook.

## Still to probe

- Claude Code: plan mode entered with Shift+Tab mid-session, a failed turn (`StopFailure`), subagent interruption, and the `agent_type` internal agents report.
- Codex: a failed turn, `request_user_input`, subagents under `--no-daemon`, whether a subagent's denial fires `Interrupt` with its `agent_id`, and whether internal threads fire `SubagentStart`.
- Antigravity: `ask_question`, subagent hooks, the status line after an Esc, and compaction's rewrite of the transcript.
- The status line bridge in a live NovaDeck terminal, for Claude Code and Antigravity.
- macOS and Windows: the hook's process ancestry, and every probe above.
