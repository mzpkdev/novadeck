# Harness coverage

What Claude Code, Codex and Antigravity expose for each feature of the
[agent model](harness-adapters.md#agent-model), measured for step 3 of the
[harness adapters](harness-adapters.md#implementation-sequence) design. Levels use
`FeatureCoverage`: **complete** means both entering and leaving the state are
signaled, including failure and interruption; **partial** means some of it is;
**unsupported** means no usable native source exists.

Evidence:

- **Probed** means captured from a real run on 2026-09-29. Sanitized payloads are in
  `application/runner/src/harnesses/<id>/fixtures/`, and `fixtures.test.ts` checks
  the claims below that rest on them.
- **Documented** means the harness's own documentation, not yet seen in a run.

| Harness     | Version   | How it was measured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ----------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | 2.1.285   | Probed: `claude -p`, and the interactive TUI driven in a PTY, both with every hook event registered through `--settings`. Documented: hooks, status line, agent view and monitoring references.                                                                                        |
| Codex       | 0.158.0   | Probed: `codex exec --json` and its rollout file, and the interactive TUI driven in a PTY, with hooks in a throwaway `CODEX_HOME` holding only the probe's hooks (`--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust`). Documented: hooks reference, generated hook and app-server schemas.              |
| Antigravity | 1.2.12–13 | Probed: `agy -p` and the interactive TUI driven in a PTY, in a scratch workspace whose `.agents/hooks.json` registered every event (the CLI updated itself to 1.2.13 between runs). Documented: the CLI's bundled `hooks.md`, the status line and title references, the CLI changelog. |

## Claude Code

**Hooks.** 33 events. In the probe:

- Every payload carries `session_id`, `transcript_path` and `cwd`.
- Every payload after the first prompt also carries `prompt_id`.
- Tool events carry `tool_use_id`.
- Events inside a subagent add `agent_id` and `agent_type`, and keep the root's `session_id`.
- Hooks run with `CLAUDE_PID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` in their environment.

`CLAUDE_PID` names the Claude Code process, which is root-instance evidence for `same-root-instance`.

**Sessions.**

- `SessionStart.source` is `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact` or `fork`.
- `clear` and `fork` mint a new session id.
- `SessionEnd.reason` is `clear`, `resume`, `logout`, `prompt_input_exit` or `other`.
- Closing the terminal (SIGHUP) fired `SessionEnd` with reason `other` (probed). A crash or SIGKILL should fire nothing (not probed), so the PTY exit remains the fallback.

**Activity.**

- `UserPromptSubmit` starts a turn.
- `Stop` ends it normally.
- `StopFailure` ends it on an API error. It carries `error` (`rate_limit`, `overloaded`, `billing_error`, …) and replaces `Stop`.
- An Esc interrupt fires no hook, not even `Stop` or `PostToolBatch` (probed with every event registered: Esc during a running Bash call). The transcript records the call's `tool_result` with `is_error` and a user record `[Request interrupted by user for tool use]`, which marks the end of the turn (probed).
- Transcript saving is off when Claude Code inherits `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`, as a process started from another Claude Code session does (probed: the TUI says so). NovaDeck's shells must not pass that variable on, or the transcript fallback disappears.
- `claude agents --json` reports `busy`, `waiting` or `idle` per session and is documented as the supported way to read state from outside. It is a polled command, not a stream.

In the probe, a background subagent's result began a second turn with its own `UserPromptSubmit` and `Stop`. So a turn does not always start with the person typing.

**Attention.**

- `PermissionRequest` fires as the prompt opens. It carries `tool_name`, `tool_input` and `permission_suggestions`, but no `tool_use_id` or request id.
- `PreToolUse` fires just before it with the `tool_use_id` (probed), so the request correlates with the preceding tool call.
- Approval shows as that call's `PostToolUse`.
- A denial by the person fires nothing, not even `Stop` or `PostToolBatch` (probed interactively with every event registered). `PermissionDenied` covers auto mode only. The transcript records the call's `tool_result` with `is_error`, the interruption and `turn_duration`, so the transcript resolves the request as denied and ends the turn.
- In print mode (`-p`), where no one can answer, the denied call is instead listed in `PostToolBatch` with its `tool_use_id` (probed).
- Questions are the `AskUserQuestion` tool. It fires `PreToolUse`, then `PermissionRequest` like any tool (probed), so the question's kind comes from `tool_name`. Its `PostToolUse` carries `tool_response.answers`, keyed by question text (probed). MCP elicitations have `Elicitation` and `ElicitationResult` with an `elicitation_id`.
- `PermissionRequest`, `Elicitation` and `PreToolUse` can answer: a later `respond`/`answer` capability has a native path.

**Actors.**

- `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` carry `agent_id` and `agent_type`, and `SubagentStop` adds `agent_transcript_path`.
- The parent's `Agent` tool call links to the child through `subagents/agent-<id>.meta.json` (`toolUseId`), an undocumented file.
- Internal agents (prompt suggestions, `/btw`) also fire `SubagentStop`, with an empty `agent_type` and no `SubagentStart` (probed); ignore a stop for an agent never seen starting.
- Subagent failure or interruption has no distinct signal.

**Transcripts.**

- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<cwd slug>/<session>.jsonl`, plus `subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`.
- Records chain by `uuid`/`parentUuid`, and tool calls link by `tool_use_id`.
- Record types beyond `user`, `assistant` and `system` are internal and change between versions.
- The file is written asynchronously and may lag the hooks.

**Planning.**

- Hooks carry `permission_mode`; `plan` means planning mode. No hook fires on the mode change itself; the status line reruns on it.
- While planning, Claude Code writes the draft with the `Write` tool to `~/.claude/plans/<name>.md` (probed), so `Write` hooks on that directory are a native draft signal.
- `ExitPlanMode` asks for review: `PreToolUse` then `PermissionRequest`, both with `plan` (Markdown) and `planFilePath` in `tool_input` (probed). Its `PostToolUse` means the plan was approved.
- Rejecting the plan fires nothing, as a denial does (probed); the transcript records it the same way.

**Usage, limits, context.**

- **Transcript:** `assistant.message.usage` has input, output and cache counts. Several records can belong to one API response, so deduplicate by `requestId`.
- **Status line:** the JSON on stdin has
  - `cost.total_cost_usd` (a client-side estimate),
  - `context_window` (size, `used_percentage`, current usage),
  - `rate_limits.five_hour` and `rate_limits.seven_day`, each with `used_percentage` (0–100) and `resets_at` (epoch seconds).
- `rate_limits` appears only for subscription accounts, and only after the first response. A missing window is unknown, not zero.
- No other source carries rate limits.

## Codex

**Hooks.** 12 events: `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`, `Stop` and `Interrupt`.

- Every payload carries `session_id`, `cwd` and `transcript_path` (the rollout). All but `SessionEnd` also carry `model` and `permission_mode` (probed).
- Turn-scoped events carry `turn_id`.
- Tool events carry `tool_use_id`, except `PermissionRequest`.
- Hooks run as direct children of the `codex` process (probed), so the hook's parent process identifies the Codex instance.
- The hook's environment carries no thread id (probed).
- A spawned subagent's `SubagentStart` and tool events carry its `agent_id` and its own `turn_id`, under the root's `session_id` (probed). Spawning shows as the tool `collaborationspawn_agent`.
- A plugin's hooks stay inert until the person reviews and trusts them in `/hooks`. Trust is kept against the hook definition's hash, and no hook announces the missing trust. The app-server's `hooks/list` reports it.

**Sessions.**

- `SessionStart.source` is `startup`, `resume`, `clear`, `compact` or `fork`.
- `SessionEnd` fires on a normal end only.
- The thread id from `codex exec --json`, the rollout file name and `session_meta.id`/`session_id` are the same value, and the hook's `session_id` is that id (probed).
- `CODEX_THREAD_ID` reaches commands Codex runs, not the TUI.

**Activity.**

- `UserPromptSubmit` starts a user turn; the rollout's `task_started` covers every turn.
- `Stop` ends a turn. `Interrupt` fires with the turn's `turn_id` when Esc interrupts a running tool, with no `PostToolUse` or `Stop` after it (probed); the rollout records `turn_aborted`.
- A failed turn (usage limit, context exceeded) fires no hook and leaves no rollout record, so activity becomes unknown there.

**Attention.**

- `PermissionRequest` carries `tool_name` and `tool_input` but no id. It follows the call's `PreToolUse`, the same as for Claude Code (probed).
- Approval shows as that call's `PostToolUse` (probed). A denial (Esc) fires `Interrupt` for the turn (probed), which resolves the request and ends the turn.
- Approvals are not written to the rollout.
- `request_user_input` is a function tool, and whether it reaches `PreToolUse` needs a probe.
- `PermissionRequest` can answer `allow` or `deny`.

**Actors.**

- `SubagentStart` and `SubagentStop` carry `agent_id` and `agent_type`, and `SubagentStop` adds `agent_transcript_path`.
- Each subagent has its own rollout whose `session_meta.source.subagent.thread_spawn` names the parent thread.
- Internal threads (`review`, `compact`, `guardian`, `memory_consolidation`) are not the person's agents.

**Transcripts.** The rollout is JSONL at `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<time>-<thread>.jsonl`.

- Records are `session_meta`, `turn_context`, `event_msg` (`task_started`, `item_completed`, `token_count`, `task_complete`, `turn_aborted`, `context_compacted`, …), `response_item`, `token_usage_record`, `world_state` and `compacted`.
- Items appear only once completed (probed), so a running command is visible only through `PreToolUse`.
- The format is undocumented and changed recently (`history_mode`, `migrate-rollouts`).

**Planning.** Hooks carry `permission_mode: plan`. Plans are the `update_plan` tool, visible through `PreToolUse` and `PostToolUse`.

**Usage, limits, context.** The rollout's `token_count` holds:

- `info.total_token_usage` (cumulative for the thread) and `info.last_token_usage` (the latest response): input, cached, cache write, output, reasoning and total tokens.
- `info.model_context_window`.
- `rate_limits.primary` and `rate_limits.secondary`, each with `used_percent` (0–100, probed), `window_minutes` and `resets_at` (epoch seconds, probed). `secondary` can be null.

Other facts:

- `token_usage_record` gives usage per response and per turn.
- No source reports a cost.
- Occupancy is estimated from the last response's input tokens over `model_context_window`.

## Antigravity

**Hooks.** Five events: `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PreInvocation`, `PostInvocation` and `Stop`.

- Every payload carries `conversationId`, `workspacePaths`, `transcriptPath`, `artifactDirectoryPath` and `modelName`.
- `PreToolUse` can allow, deny or ask; `PostInvocation` and `Stop` can force the loop to continue.
- Hooks run through `sh`, whose parent is the `agy` process (probed), so the hook's grandparent identifies the Antigravity instance.
- The hook's environment has `ANTIGRAVITY_CONVERSATION_ID` (probed). It also inherits every ancestor's variables: probed under Claude Code, it carried `CLAUDE_PID`. An environment variable therefore never proves which harness sent a report.
- Workspace hooks in `.agents/hooks.json` ran without a trust prompt in print mode; the interactive TUI asked to trust the folder first (probed).
- **A `PreToolUse` answer without a `decision` is a denial** (probed: `{}` denied every tool with "tool call denied by pre-tool hook"). An observing hook must answer `{"decision": "ask"}`, which leaves the person's own permission policy in charge; `force_ask` always shows the confirmation.

**Sessions.**

- `/clear`, `/resume` and `/fork` switch conversations inside one process. The only sign is a new `conversationId` on the next hook, from the same `agy` process (probed with `/clear`).
- Nothing marks the end of a session.

**Activity.**

- `PreInvocation` fires before each model call; `PostInvocation` fires after it.
- `Stop` ends the execution loop with `terminationReason`, `error` and `fullyIdle` (false while background tasks run). The probe saw `NO_TOOL_CALL`, where the documentation lists `model_stop`, `max_steps_exceeded` and `error`, so decoders must accept values beyond those.
- A completed tool fires `PostToolUse` with the `stepIdx` of its `PreToolUse` (probed). A failed or denied one fires no `PostToolUse`.
- Denying a confirmation fires nothing more for that turn: no `PostToolUse`, `PostInvocation` or `Stop` (probed).
- Esc fires nothing: pressed during a reply, no `PostInvocation` or `Stop` followed; pressed while an approved command ran in the foreground, no `PostToolUse` or `Stop` followed (probed). The transcript drops the cancelled steps.
- An approved command still running after about 2 s moves to the background: the turn ends with `Stop` and `fullyIdle: false` while it runs (probed).

**Attention.**

- There is no permission hook. Whether a confirmation shows depends on the person's policy, so `PreToolUse` alone does not mean one is open.
- The status line's `tool_confirmation_pending` says a confirmation dialog is open, without naming the step. With the preceding `PreToolUse`, it identifies the request.
- The confirmation offers yes, yes for this conversation, yes persisted, and no. Approval shows as `PostToolUse` for the step; a denial ends the turn silently.
- The `ask_question` tool probably shows as `PreToolUse`, pending a probe.

**Actors.** Subagents are separate conversations. Hooks do not say whether they fire for them. `conversation_summaries.db` records `parent_conversation_id` and `nesting_depth`.

**Transcripts.** Every hook names the transcript, a JSONL file. It is rewritten on compaction, so following it must handle truncation. Its record format is undocumented.

**Planning.** Plan mode exists (`--mode plan`, `/plan`), and the status line reports `execution_mode`. Plans, task lists and walkthroughs are artifacts under `artifactDirectoryPath`. No signal marks a plan's approval.

**Usage, limits, context.** The status line only. Its JSON on stdin has:

- `agent_state` (`idle`, `thinking`, `working`, `tool_use`, `initializing`),
- `context_window` (size, used percentage, token totals),
- `quota` per model (`remaining_fraction`, `reset_time`, `reset_in_seconds`),
- `cost`, `task_count` and `pending_input_count`.

It also carries the account's `email`, which must not leave the adapter.

## Consequences for the design

1. **A status line bridge is the only route to some features.** It is the only live source for:
   - Claude Code's rate limits and context occupancy,
   - Antigravity's agent state, attention, usage, limits and context.

   A status line is a single user-level setting. For feature parity NovaDeck installs a bridge command that forwards to the person's own status line command, so their status line keeps working. For Claude Code, NovaDeck's shells can pass `--settings` at launch, as the Codex shim does for its flag, so the bridge applies only to NovaDeck's terminals. See [the design](harness-adapters.md#native-sources).

2. **Permissions have no request ids.** Requests correlate with the preceding `PreToolUse`: its `tool_use_id` for Claude Code and Codex, its `stepIdx` for Antigravity. A matching `PostToolUse` means allowed.
   - A denial fires nothing in Claude Code and Antigravity; Claude Code's transcript records it.
   - A denial fires `Interrupt` in Codex.
   - Otherwise the next tool, turn or session event resolves the request with an `unknown` outcome.
3. **NovaDeck's Antigravity hook must answer `PreToolUse` with `{"decision": "ask"}`.** An empty answer denies every tool.
4. **Interruption is harness-specific.**
   - Codex fires `Interrupt`.
   - Claude Code fires nothing; its transcript records the interruption and the turn's end.
   - Antigravity fires nothing, and its transcript drops the cancelled steps. Its status line's `agent_state` returning to `idle` is the remaining signal.

   Without such a source, a turn stays `working` until the next event, and coverage says so.

5. **Every harness identifies its instance through the hook's process ancestry.**
   - Claude Code sets `CLAUDE_PID`.
   - A Codex hook's parent is `codex`.
   - An Antigravity hook's grandparent, through `sh`, is `agy`.

   The hook host should report the nearest ancestor whose executable is the harness, found through its `programs`. That gives `same-root-instance` evidence for all three, so Antigravity's `conversation-observed` switching can tighten. Linux was probed; macOS and Windows need their own process lookup. Inherited environment variables cannot stand in for it.

6. **Limits are percentages, not token counts.** Every harness reports windows as a used or remaining fraction with an absolute reset instant: Claude Code and Codex in epoch seconds, Antigravity as a time. None reports the limit itself, so the telemetry model stores fractions and never derives token amounts.
7. **Codex hook trust is a separate readiness state.** A connected Codex with untrusted hooks reports nothing. Detecting that needs the app-server's `hooks/list`, not a hook.

## Still to probe

- Claude Code: plan mode entered with Shift+Tab mid-session, a failed turn (`StopFailure`), and subagent interruption.
- Codex: a failed turn, `request_user_input`, plan mode, and subagents under `--no-daemon`.
- Antigravity: `ask_question`, plan mode artifacts, subagent hooks, the status line payload in a NovaDeck terminal, and the transcript and artifact formats.
- The status line bridge for Claude Code and Antigravity, once built.
- macOS and Windows: the hook's process ancestry, and every probe above.
