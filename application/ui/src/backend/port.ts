// The rest of the UI relies on this markup from the surface:
// - Its root carries `data-terminal-content` (view transitions morph it) and the
//   `terminal-content` class (layout and canvas styles size and fade it).
// - Its root carries `nodrag nopan`, so Canvas does not drag or pan from the content,
//   and stops `wheel` propagation without Ctrl/Meta, so scrolling output does not
//   zoom the canvas while pinch and Ctrl+wheel still do.
// - It sets `hidden={minimized && !clipContent}`, `aria-hidden` and `inert` from
//   `minimized`; Grid keeps a minimizing surface painted while its height animates.
// - The element that takes typed input carries `data-terminal-input`, so shortcuts
//   treat it as terminal input and search returns focus to it.
// - Its own styles may key off the frame's `terminal-compact` (Grid and Canvas) and
//   `terminal-focused` (Focus) classes; ship them with the adapter.
// Attach to a running terminal from the surface's effects; `commit` handles lifecycle.
