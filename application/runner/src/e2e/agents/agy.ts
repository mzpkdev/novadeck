 * Antigravity against the fake model: its own folder in the sandbox's `~/.gemini`, seeded
 * past onboarding and its colour-scheme picker and trusting the project, and set to the
 * Gemini API with a key, as it runs without signing in. Signed in with Google it speaks
 * Code Assist instead, but takes its models only from an account's plan, which a fake
 * login can't name, so it never gets as far as a model call. Its updater is off.
 * Seeded with `folderTrusted: false`, it trusts no folder, and asks first. Its hooks need
 * no trust, so `hooksTrusted` changes nothing.
