// A Stop can lose to the reply it races: a harness that had the model's reply before it
// took the Escape finishes its turn all the same, and may fire its Stop even where it took
// the key just after (docs/harness-coverage.md, "Escape against a reply on its way"). The
// runner reads the turn as the harness ended it: completed, with that reply as `lastTurn`,
// where the reply won, interrupted where the key did, and never completed for a moment
// before it says interrupted (that moment is a "t1 is done" notification). Which wins is the
// harness's, so each attempt presses a raw Escape as a held reply is let go, `lead` ms
// before it, until one is lost; every attempt's turn must read as the screen shows it ended.
// A lead that lands the key in the reply's window loses it the most often (probed 2026-10-07,
// docs/harness-coverage.md): Claude Code's takes it just after the reply most times, Codex's
// takes it too, though its Stop fires first, and 200 ms ahead its reply wins, the Stop told
// before the key; Antigravity's reply wins the key let go together with it, the Stop told after.
