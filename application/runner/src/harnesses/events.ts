 * with a `prompt` submitted at the root (the person's, as far as anything tells), one
 * the harness started by itself (a background task's result), a later model `call` of a
 * turn already running, or NovaDeck's `doorbell`: a prompt that is exactly its line. It ends `completed` only when its harness says so (a root
 * Stop, which may leave work it started running in the `background`); `turn-idle` says
 * the agent shows idle however its turn ended, which without such a Stop was an Esc or a
 * denial. `turn-working` says it shows working, which starts no turn: it only resumes one
 * a `turn-idle` older than it ended, never one a Stop did. A request asked `midTurn`
 * waits on the person only while a turn runs, so a stale one after a Stop asks nothing.
 * `file-touched` names a file an actor wrote or edited. A request has no id of its own
 * in any harness, so `requestId` is derived from the tool call it asks about and the
 * actor that asks: the root agent, or a subagent by its id. A result marked `loose`
 * resolves the actor's oldest request of that tool when its call changed on the way, as
 * an answered question's does.
