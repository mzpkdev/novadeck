 * Cursor. A turn starts with UserPromptSubmit, which Claude Code also sends with a task
 * notification as it starts a turn by itself, and ends with Stop, which lists background
 * tasks still running, or StopFailure on an API error; a subagent's stop ends only its
 * own work. PermissionRequest asks the person
 * about a tool call, AskUserQuestion's as a question and ExitPlanMode's as a plan to
 * review, for the root agent or a subagent;
 * the call's PostToolUse or PostToolUseFailure from that actor means it was allowed. An
 * answered question's call gains its answers, and a plan may be edited in review, so
 * their results match loosely. A denial or
 * an Esc fires nothing: the next turn settles them.
