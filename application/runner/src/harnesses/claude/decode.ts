/**
 * Claude Code's hooks, as normalized facts.
 *
 * SessionStart names the session running in the terminal, unless it is not the
 * terminal's own: a subagent's (it carries `agent_id`), or Claude Code running inside
 * Cursor. A turn starts with UserPromptSubmit and ends with Stop, or StopFailure on an
 * API error; a subagent's stop ends only its own work. PermissionRequest asks the person
 * about a tool call, AskUserQuestion's as a question and ExitPlanMode's as a plan to
 * review, for the root agent or a subagent;
 * the call's PostToolUse or PostToolUseFailure from that actor means it was allowed. An
 * answered question's call gains its answers, so its result matches loosely. A denial or
 * an Esc fires nothing: the next turn settles them.
