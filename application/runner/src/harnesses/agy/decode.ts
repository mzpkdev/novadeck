/**
 * Antigravity's hooks, as normalized facts. Every hook names the conversation it runs in,
 * and nothing says how it began: /clear and /resume switch conversations in one process.
 * PreInvocation starts a model call, so the agent works: the turn's first (its
 * `invocationNum` restarts at 0 each turn) as its prompt, any later one as a call of the
 * turn already running. Stop ends the turn, as failed when it names an error, and says
 * whether background work, as a subagent, still runs (`fullyIdle`). Only a completed turn
 * fires Stop: its confirmations fire no hook, and an Esc or a denial fires nothing. Its
 * status line, which Novadeck's settings hand to the hook as StatusLine, tells both, but
 * reads the same idle after them as after a completed turn: so idle there only ends a
 * turn no Stop ended, and never as completed. It never starts a turn: only PreInvocation
 * starts one. Saying working, it resumes only a turn an older idle of its own ended, never
 * one a Stop ended; showing a confirmation, it asks one only of a turn running, as only a
 * turn asks for one.
 * Every hook names the conversation's transcript. A plan is an artifact it writes asking
 * for the person's review, which its PostToolUse names.
 * PreToolUse, which Novadeck answers "ask" at once, names the call about to run. Its
 * ask_question is a request of its own, as no status line tells that dialog, resolved by
 * its PostToolUse. Any other call may or may not ask the person, as their policy says, so
 * it asks nothing here; the latest of each conversation is only remembered, as the call a
 * confirmation the status line shows is about (see `confirmation`).
