/**
 * Antigravity's hooks, as normalized facts. Every hook names the conversation it runs in,
 * and nothing says how it began: /clear and /resume switch conversations in one process.
 * PreInvocation starts a model call, so the agent works: the turn's first (its
 * `invocationNum` restarts at 0 each turn) as its prompt, any later one as a call of the
 * turn already running. Stop ends the turn, as failed when it names an error, and says
 * whether background work, as a subagent, still runs (`fullyIdle`). Only a completed turn
 * fires Stop: its confirmations fire no hook, and an Esc or a denial fires nothing. Its
 * status line, which NovaDeck's settings hand to the hook as StatusLine, tells both, but
 * reads the same idle after them as after a completed turn: so idle there only ends a
 * turn no Stop ended, and never as completed. It never starts a turn: only PreInvocation
 * starts or resumes one.
 * Every hook names the conversation's transcript. A plan is an artifact it writes asking
 * for the person's review, which its PostToolUse names.
