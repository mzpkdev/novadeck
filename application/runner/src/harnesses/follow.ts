 * Calls `onLine` with each line appended to `path` until `signal` aborts, polling every
 * `intervalMs`. A file that already exists is followed from its end: only what is
 * written from now on counts, unless `fromStart` reads it whole first. One that does not
 * exist yet is read from its start once it appears, as an agent may create its
 * transcript after its first hook. A file that shrinks was rewritten: `onReset` is told,
 * and it is read again from its start. `onIdle` is told whenever it has read all there
 * is for now, and each read waits for `pace`, so a slow reader holds it back.
