/**
 * Novadeck's MCP server, as the runner serves it to a connected agent's plugin. The
 * agent starts Novadeck's relay (see application/relay), which carries its messages, one
 * JSON-RPC message per line, to the runner of the terminal it runs in, over the endpoint
 * the agent's hooks report to, and the answers back; outside Novadeck's terminals the
 * relay answers the handshake itself, with no tools. Its tools: `show`, which puts an
 * image, a text file or a web page in front of the user, beside the terminal the agent
 * runs in (one source per call, `file` or `url`, each with its own options inside it),
 * `showing`, which lists what is there now, and `close`, which takes away what the agent
 * showed, by the same file or url; `open_terminal`, which opens a
 * new terminal beside it, optionally starting a command there; `close_terminal`, which
 * closes another of the project's terminals by its handle; `send` and `agents`, which
 * message the agents in the project's other terminals and list them; and `describe`,
 * which names the agent's own terminal and says what it works on (see
 * docs/agent-messaging.md). Each call goes to the terminal's runner with the terminal's
 * own token, as the relay named them, and the runner's answer is told back as text.
 * Only Claude Code reads a server's own instructions, so each tool's description carries
 * its rules.
