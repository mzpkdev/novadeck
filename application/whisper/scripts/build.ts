// The whisper.cpp engine voice input downloads, built for this platform:

//   node scripts/build.ts     builds dist/novadeck-whisper-<platform>-<arch>.tar.gz and
//                             dist/engine.json, which names it with its SHA-256 and size
//                             and the interface it speaks
//
// The archive holds `whisper-server`, the libraries and backend modules it loads, a
// sample of speech for the post-install check and whisper.cpp's licence, all flat. The
// build itself, shared with the murmur engine, is application/ggml-build.
