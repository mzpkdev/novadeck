# NovaDeck

A terminal workspace for organizing projects, sessions, and parallel work.

Focus on one terminal, arrange several in a grid, or spread them across a zoomable
canvas. Keep related work together and switch between sessions from the sidebar.

In Canvas, scroll to zoom in or out, and drag the background or an inactive terminal
to pan. Click a terminal to activate it, then select its text, scroll its output,
or drag its header to move it. Activating a terminal brings it in front of the
others; Canvas retains that stacking order until you leave the view.
Double-click or double-tap a terminal header outside its name to smoothly center and zoom that terminal
to fit the canvas viewport. Repeat the gesture on the same terminal to return to the
previous camera position and zoom. Manual pan or zoom (including keyboard shortcuts),
Fit all, sidebar camera navigation, leaving Canvas, or switching sessions clears that
return point. Flying to a different terminal starts a new visit from the current camera.
Repeated double gestures during a flight are ignored. Minimized terminals restore first;
returning the camera does not minimize them again. The header's arrow opens Focus view.

Click **New terminal** or use its keyboard shortcut to create and select a terminal
immediately in any view, with or without Zen. Focus shows it right away. Grid uses
an available slot and scrolls it into view. Canvas chooses a nearby free position,
preferring the current viewport, and pans only as needed to reveal it without changing
zoom. Terminals can be moved or resized immediately; there is no placement step.
Right-click the Grid or Canvas background and choose **Terminal** to create one without entering
rename mode. In Canvas, its top-left corner is placed at that canvas point without moving the
camera. Terminals created with the New terminal control open in rename mode with their name
selected: in the sidebar when visible, or in the terminal header otherwise. Enter or clicking
away saves the name; Escape keeps the original name. In any
view, double-click or double-tap a terminal's name in its header to rename it
directly; in the sidebar, use the tab's Rename button or F2. The header and sidebar share rename mode and
the live draft. Move between either name field to continue editing; saving or
canceling ends the edit in both places.

Terminal tabs show the program in the foreground in small gray text beneath the
name, updating as programs start and finish; the line stays empty when it is unknown.
The runner reports each terminal's foreground process as its name and, on Linux, the
process group leader's command line (`argv`); macOS reports only the name, and Windows
reports none. `application/ui/src/model/process.ts` turns that into a program name,
resolving known Node CLIs from the script Node runs, so the Codex and Claude packages
show as `codex` and `claude` while other Node programs stay `node`. Where the process
cannot tell, as on Windows or for a Node CLI on macOS, a connected agent that reported
its session since the shell's last prompt names the program.

While a program holds the foreground, its profile decides how the terminal looks.
`application/ui/src/terminals/processes/profiles.ts` maps program names to a tab and
header icon and a body around the terminal's content; programs it does not list,
shells, and terminals starting or ended use Lucide's Terminal icon and no body. Every
terminal keeps the same `application/ui/src/terminals/WindowShell.tsx` window, so a
program starting or ending never replaces the header: a rename in progress, focus,
and the terminal switcher carry on. Claude and Codex have their own icons in
`application/ui/src/ui-toolkit/icons/` and their own bodies beside the profiles, where
their presentation can grow. To give another program its own look, add a profile
entry, with its own body if needed, and a launcher entry in `model/process.ts` if it
runs as a Node script. Profiles are presentation only: per-program behaviour goes beside
`programName` in `model/`, as `model/resume.ts` names the agents whose sessions resume.

The backend port keeps windows out of the backend: a surface renders one content
element and passes it to `renderWindow`, and `WorkspaceTerminal.tsx` wraps it in the
shared window and the profile's body. The surface keeps its controller mounted above
that, so a program change swaps the body without restarting the terminal; the runner
surface moves its one xterm host into the new body, keeping output, selection and focus.
Switching between Focus, Grid and Canvas mounts a new surface, which takes the same
xterm and attachment from `backend/runner/screens.ts` instead of opening and attaching
again. A terminal no view shows keeps them while its session is on screen and lets them
go a moment after its session leaves the screen or the terminal closes.

The runner owns every terminal: which terminals a session has, their names (the ones
you give them; else one an agent gave, or your first prompt to its agent, shortened;
else its own "Terminal 01", "Terminal 02", … per session), directories, what
they run and the program each last had in its foreground (only its name, never its
command line, which can hold secrets). The UI shows them, renames through the runner,
and saves only how it shows them: layouts, sidebar order, the view and the selection,
by terminal id. A terminal has a `restoredProcess` only while it
has no live shell: a program running when the runner lost the shell, the shell was
killed, or the app closed becomes it, and it ends once a shell reaches its prompt or
runs a program. Every replacement shell starts in the runner backend's `freshShell`,
which resumes that program when it can (see [Restoring terminals](#restoring-terminals)).
Quitting or closing the desktop app's window saves before the runner ends its shells,
except on macOS, where closing the last window leaves them running, so the save reflects
that close rather than the final quit. A system shutdown or log-off saves the same way:
on Linux and macOS it quits the app, and on Windows the window saves as soon as the
session may end.

Use the terminal header's resize control to alternate between two sizes. In Canvas,
**Enlarge** matches the current Canvas viewport aspect ratio at a fixed area equivalent
to 1200×800, independent of zoom. **Compact** sets 600×400. Extreme ratios respect the
minimum terminal dimensions. Double-click the enlarged terminal header to fill more
of the viewport. Canvas grows or shrinks around the terminal's center
without changing the camera. In Grid, **Make full width** fills the available columns;
**Restore width** returns to the width at each breakpoint from before that click,
preserving terminal height. Resizing restores minimized terminals.
Preset choices are remembered per terminal, session, and view. New terminals start
compact: 600×400 in Canvas and compact column width in Grid, with no placement preview.

In Grid, selecting a terminal from its tab smoothly scrolls it into view. With
reduced motion enabled, it scrolls immediately.
Double-clicking or double-tapping a Focus or Grid terminal header outside its
name has no effect; use the header action to move between those views.

A terminal tab's tooltip says who its name is from: you, the agent in another terminal
(`t2`), your first prompt there, or the default. Right-click a tab for **Rename**,
**Close**, and, for a name you gave, **Reset to automatic**, which hands the name back
to NovaDeck.

When agents message each other (see [Agent messaging](docs/agent-messaging.md)), a
terminal's tab counts the messages waiting for its agent: queued, being delivered or
held, never those delivered. The count turns amber when a thread is held for your
release, and shows a pause mark while messaging is paused. A terminal with an agent, or
one that has had messages, gets a **Messages** icon in its taskbar, which opens its
threads in the companion pane: one per peer, latest first, each message with its
direction, time, state and the agent's text exactly as written, never formatted. A held
thread has **Release**, and the pane's header has **Pause all agents' messages**, one
switch for every project and session. It all updates as messages move. The content preview
(`pnpm dev:previews`) shows a thread between its two agents; the behaviour specs' demo
(`?demo=messages`) has every state, a held thread and the pause.

Right-click a window's header for the same menu as its sidebar tab: Rename, Reset to
automatic for a name you gave, Dock in for an undocked window, and Close.

Use the eye on a terminal tab to hide it from Grid and Canvas without closing it.
Hidden tabs stay in the list with a faded label. While selected, a hidden terminal
appears at 50% opacity in Grid and Canvas, then disappears when it is no longer active.
Its hidden setting stays unchanged; use the eye to make it visible permanently.
Hidden terminals retain
their content and layout and remain available in Focus view.
Showing and hiding use a short fade and scale transition; reduced motion skips it.
Switching terminal tabs in Focus uses the same transition.

## Restoring terminals

After a reboot, NovaDeck opens each terminal where it was: in the directory its shell
was last in, with its earlier output shown above a fresh prompt, and with Claude Code,
Codex or Antigravity resumed in the session that was running once you connect that
agent.

- **Shell integration.** Each shell NovaDeck starts loads your own startup files first,
  then reports its directory at every prompt: bash through `--init-file`, zsh through
  `ZDOTDIR`, fish through `--init-command`, PowerShell by dot-sourcing a script after
  your profile, and cmd through its `PROMPT`. Other shells start as they are. A new
  terminal and a restart open in the last reported directory. This comes from files in
  NovaDeck's own data directory (a `shell` folder beside `workspace.sqlite`) and never
  touches your rc files.
- **Connecting agents.** The first-run welcome dialog includes an interactive preview
  of Focus, Grid, and Canvas, which shows each layout once until you pick one (never with
  reduced motion), plus a choice of agents, with every installed one chosen, and of
  transcripts, on. A chosen agent's preview terminal shows it connected.
  “Let’s build something” applies those choices; skipping, Escape, or clicking outside
  dismisses the dialog without connecting agents or changing transcripts. The preview is illustrative and
  starts no terminals. Preferences offers the same agents as immediate switches;
  an agent that is not installed cannot be selected. Connecting installs a small NovaDeck plugin into
  it with the agent's own plugin commands (`claude plugin`, `codex plugin`,
  `agy plugin`, from a local marketplace or folder in NovaDeck's data directory);
  turning it off uninstalls it. The plugin holds a single hook that tells the NovaDeck
  terminal it runs in which session it is, and does nothing when the agent runs
  anywhere else. It adds nothing to the model's context but the messages other agents in
  NovaDeck send it, wrapped as theirs (see [Agent messaging](docs/agent-messaging.md)).
  Agents address each other by terminal handle, `t3` for "Terminal 03", which stays
  the terminal's when you rename it.
  Without a connected agent
  there is no resume, even for sessions it reported before: disconnecting forgets them,
  and the terminal comes back as a plain shell with its transcript.
- **Resuming.** When a terminal lost a connected agent, its fresh shell comes back
  with that session already running: the runner runs `claude --resume <id>`,
  `codex resume <id>` or `agy --conversation <id>` as the shell starts, after your rc
  files and prompt hooks, as if you had typed it at the first prompt, but nothing is
  typed and nothing goes into your shell history. When the agent exits you are at
  that shell's prompt. Typing before it starts, as while a slow rc file runs, cancels
  it, so the shell gets what you typed. A terminal without a known session gets a
  plain shell, never "continue the last session", a session resumes in one terminal
  only, never beside another running it, and a shell NovaDeck cannot integrate shows
  its transcript instead. An rc file that replaces the shell, as with `exec fish` or
  `exec tmux`, resumes nothing. Terminals with an agent to resume start at once, in every session and
  hidden or not; the others start when their session is shown.
- **Transcripts.** Each terminal's recent output is kept, and a restored terminal shows
  it read-only above a separator and its fresh prompt; a resumed agent shows its own
  history instead. Transcripts are on by default and can be turned off in Preferences,
  which also forgets the saved ones. They can contain secrets that were typed or
  printed: they live in `workspace.sqlite`, readable by your account only, with up to
  256 KiB kept per terminal.

Codex may ask you to review NovaDeck's hook ("Hooks need review") and records the
answer itself; it asks again only when NovaDeck changes how its hook is registered, as
when the hook gained its time limit for agent messaging.
Interactive Codex normally runs its sessions, hooks included, in a shared background
server that cannot tell which terminal a session belongs to. So while Codex is
connected, NovaDeck's shells run `codex` through a small shim that adds `--no-daemon`,
keeping the session in the terminal, and sets its terminal title's items to its state
and thread, which tells NovaDeck when its prompt is up (NovaDeck shows no terminal's own
title); `codex agents` and `--remote`, which need that server, go unchanged, and Codex
started by its full path bypasses the shim and does not resume. Sessions started this
way do not show in `codex agents`.
Antigravity runs the hook before each model call, and Codex with your first message,
so their sessions are known from then on; before that, Codex's title and Antigravity's
status line tell NovaDeck that their prompt is up, so other agents' messages can wake
them. On Windows, Claude Code runs the hook through PowerShell.

Removing NovaDeck does not remove plugins you left connected, as packaged builds have
no uninstaller: switch agents off first, or remove the `novadeck` plugin with the
agent's own `plugin` command. A plugin left behind does nothing.

The runner saves each terminal's directory and agent sessions as they change, and its
output every few seconds and when the app quits, so a crash or a power cut loses little.
Once the runner starts shutting down it saves nothing more, so shells ending on the way
out cannot replace what it saved while they ran.

## Zen mode

The project switcher in the top bar removes a project from its row's trash icon, after
you confirm; its terminals close, and the folder on disk stays. The last project stays.
The backends don't remove projects yet: on the runner it comes back on the next reload.

Choose **Enter Zen mode** in the top bar to hide the header, sidebar, rail, and footer
without leaving the current Focus, Grid, or Canvas view. The floating dock provides
New terminal, enabled view choices, and Exit Zen. At rest it folds to New terminal and a
small chevron. Click or tap the chevron to toggle the remaining controls, or activate
it with Enter or Space. Clicking outside, leaving with keyboard focus, or pressing Escape folds it again.
Canvas navigation uses gestures and
keyboard shortcuts: +/− to zoom and 0 to fit all terminals.
Focus becomes an edge-to-edge terminal, while Grid and Canvas gain the available space.
In any view, click the terminal icon beside the name to open the terminal switcher.
Choose a terminal, or use Up/Down and Enter. Escape closes the switcher.
This also works outside Zen; double-click or double-tap the name still renames it.
Terminal names stay visible; header actions appear on hover or keyboard focus on desktop
and stay visible on touch devices. Search and terminal shortcuts remain available.

Zen preserves the active terminal and Canvas camera on entry. Exit Zen restores the
previous sidebar visibility and panel. Explicit sidebar shortcuts or Browse sessions
leave Zen to show the requested panel. Zen is temporary and resets on reload.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action                                            | macOS            | Windows and Linux  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Find a terminal                                   | `Cmd+K`          | `Ctrl+Shift+K`     |
| Recent terminals                                  | `Ctrl+Tab`       | `Ctrl+Tab`         |
| Cycle backward through recent terminals           | `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | `Ctrl+Shift+Tab`   |
| Toggle Focus and the previous Grid or Canvas view | `Cmd+Enter`      | `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` |
| New terminal                                      | `Cmd+T`          | `Ctrl+Shift+T`     |

When navigating the workspace outside terminal input, text editors, and dialogs,
these simpler keys work in both normal and Zen mode:

| Key      | Action                                            |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `T`      | New terminal                                      |
| `/`      | Find a terminal                                   |
| `F`      | Toggle Focus and the previous Grid or Canvas view |
| `Z`      | Toggle Zen                                        |
| `B`      | Toggle terminal sidebar (leaves Zen to show it)   |
| `F2`     | Rename the active terminal                        |
| `Delete` | Close the active terminal                         |

The modifier shortcuts above remain available from terminal input. Workspace keys
never replace typing, editing, or dialog navigation.

The new-session shortcut creates and selects an empty session in the current project
and opens the Sessions sidebar.

Sidebar shortcuts open or switch to their panel; pressing the same shortcut again hides it.

Hold Ctrl while pressing Tab to choose a terminal, then release Ctrl to switch.
Up and Down select terminals in sidebar order in Focus, Grid, and Canvas, wrapping
at either end. Selection pans Canvas or scrolls Grid just like clicking a tab.
Left and Right cycle through enabled views in Focus → Grid → Canvas order, wrapping
at either end and retaining the selected terminal.
Escape first deselects the active terminal in any view, then hides the open sidebar
on the next press. Further presses do nothing. Focus keeps the displayed terminal
in place; clicking it activates it again. Terminal input, editors, and dialogs
retain Escape without changing workspace selection.
Text inputs and open dialogs retain their own arrow behavior. Arrow keys no longer
pan the canvas camera. While the recent switcher is open, Up and Down cycle its list.
The new-terminal shortcut creates a terminal immediately and opens the desktop Terminals sidebar
when outside Zen. On narrow screens the sidebar stays closed so the new terminal is visible. The name editor receives focus. These shortcuts are available in the desktop app; browsers may
reserve `Ctrl+Tab` for changing browser tabs. The Shortcuts tab in Preferences
groups bindings into Anywhere and Workspace for the current platform. On the Canvas
background, `+`/`−` zoom and `0` fits all terminals.

## Development

Requires Node.js 26 and pnpm 11.22.0. Run commands from the repository root.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`pnpm dev` launches the Electron desktop application. To run the UI and runner
in a browser instead:

```sh
pnpm dev:web
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:5173>. `dev:web` starts a runner with a fresh random token
and hands the same token to the UI dev server. For UI-only work, use
`pnpm --filter @novadeck/ui dev` with `VITE_NOVADECK_RUNNER_URL` and
`VITE_NOVADECK_RUNNER_TOKEN` pointing at a runner you started.

NovaDeck has no database migrations before its first release. A runner that opens a
`workspace.sqlite` an earlier build wrote, whose tables differ from its own, refuses to
start and names the file: delete it (it holds your projects, sessions and kept
terminals) and start again. A standalone runner keeps it at
`~/.local/share/novadeck/workspace.sqlite` unless `NOVADECK_DATABASE` is set; the
desktop app keeps it in its data folder, `NovaDeck` on every platform:
`~/.config/NovaDeck/workspace.sqlite` on Linux, `~/Library/Application
Support/NovaDeck/workspace.sqlite` on macOS and `%APPDATA%\NovaDeck\workspace.sqlite` on
Windows. NovaDeck never deletes or rewrites it
for you.

### Plan review design preview

Run `pnpm dev:previews` and open <http://127.0.0.1:5181> for a UI-only study of
how an agent's plan is reviewed in each view. NovaDeck hosts other agents, so it
neither dictates how a plan is written nor answers the agent's approval prompt.
The reader shows the Markdown as written, and the plan file is the only channel
back: notes you leave are written into it, and a small NovaDeck skill tells the
agent to re-read the plan before acting on it, apply the notes, and remove each.

Two samples show the range. “Build Studio” runs Codex with a structured plan
(headings, a task list, file paths) and the skill installed. “Refactor auth” runs
Claude Code with plain prose and no skill. Each terminal asks its own question:
answer `y` to approve or type anything else to keep planning.

A taskbar along each terminal's bottom has an icon for the plan. Opening it shows
the plan beside its terminal, never over the workspace:

- **Focus** and **Grid** split the window: terminal on the left, plan on the
  right, with a draggable divider; a narrow window stacks them.
- **Canvas** attaches the plan as a sheet beside the node, which pans and zooms
  with it; the canvas frames both as it opens.

The plan is always editable: it's the file's
Markdown in a CodeMirror 6 live-preview editor. Markdown syntax shows, dimmed,
only on the line being edited, so typing Markdown is how you format the plan;
there are no formatting controls. A heading's `#` marks hang in the margin so its
text doesn't move. Note wrappers never show. The note icon in the margin adds a
note under a line, written into the file as an HTML comment; Backspace in an empty
note removes it. Tables always render as tables: click a cell to edit it, Tab and
Shift+Tab move between cells, Enter moves down, Escape cancels, and only that
cell's text changes in the file. While a cell is being edited, a toolbar adds a
row below or a column to the right and deletes the current row or column; Tab past
the last cell starts a new row. Every row has its own note button: a row's note is
written inside the row, at the end of its last cell, and shows under it; the
header's note is on the whole table and goes after it. When the agent writes a new
version, its changes merge into yours line by line, the lines it wrote are
highlighted, and the notes it applied are gone. Without the skill, as in “Refactor
auth”, notes wait until you ask the agent in its terminal to re-read the plan.
Escape closes the plan. Plans never create sidebar tabs or separate windows.

Besides its plan, an agent can show you other things: an image, a file from the project,
a page in a preview browser. They join the plan in the terminal's companion pane, which
has no header of its own. Each gets an icon in the taskbar, as an OS taskbar has, with
several of a kind (images, files, pages, or plans) stacked under one; only Messages
never stack. A markdown file the agent shows reads as a document, formatted like a plan
with its outline, but read-only: it's the agent's file, not a plan to edit or note (the
demo's Codex has shown `docs/brand-voice.md`). The mark under an icon says whether it's
new, showing, or seen; something new hops once, and nothing opens on its own unless you
asked for it. Hover an icon to peek: a card per thing behind it, each a preview, its
name and the same mark, with no copy. Click an icon or a card to open it, click the icon
again (or press Escape) to hide the pane, and close from a card's corner button or the
icon's right-click. Anything closes, plans and Messages too: a closed plan comes back
with the agent's next version of it, Messages with the next message, and something shown
when it's shown again, last on the bar each time. (The agent can't yet reopen what you
closed when asked; nothing tells the backend.) Icons line up in the order they came,
plans and Messages among them; drag any icon to reorder the bar, a group moving as one,
or use Move left and Move right on its right-click.

Drag any icon onto another terminal's bottom bar to show it there instead (Grid and
Canvas, where both are on screen); a terminal with nothing to show grows an empty bar
while an icon is dragged over it. What's placed stays its own terminal's: its peek, menu
and pane say whose it is, an image or file stacks with the bar's own like any other, and
a plan's edits still save to that agent. A new version shown by its agent updates it
where it is. **Send back to** its terminal, on its right-click, or a drag onto that
terminal's bar, returns it. Placements are the UI's alone for now: the backends don't
keep them (`terminals/companion/placement.ts`). Messages are the exception: a terminal's
messages are its agent's conversation, so they stay on its bar. Dragged off the bar,
their icon stretches toward the pointer, giving less the further it's pulled, and
springs back when let go; nothing out there lights up for it, and the pointer shows it
can't go. Within the bar it reorders like any icon.

Any card in a peek can be dragged out too, one of a group's on its own: it turns into an
icon under the pointer, which goes wherever a dragged icon goes, onto another terminal's
bar or into a view's empty space, while the rest of a group stay grouped. Dropped where
nothing takes it, or with Escape, it settles back into the icon it came from.

Drop a plan or a single artifact in a view to undock it right there. On Canvas,
over its empty space, a ghost window joins the canvas under the pointer and follows it
freely, as a dragged window does; dropped, the window opens where the ghost was and
settles onto the canvas's grid. On Grid, a placeholder window joins the grid under
the pointer as soon as the icon is over it, and the grid makes room for it like any
window: the window it's over moves aside. It goes as the icon leaves the grid; dropped,
the window takes its place. In
“Build Studio”, type `show` to have Codex show the next thing, or `open` to play
asking it to open it; it opens `projects.json` for you as the demo starts. Files are
syntax-highlighted by their extension (JSON, JavaScript and TypeScript with JSX, CSS,
HTML, XML, Markdown, YAML, Python, Rust, Go, Java and C/C++), with each language's
parser loading the first time one of its files opens; any other file shows as plain
text. A page shows as a snapshot until the pane hosts a browser.

**Undock to its own window**, in a plan's or a viewer's header or an icon's right-click,
moves a plan or what the agent showed out of the pane into a window of its own beside
the terminal; a plan stays editable there. It joins the sidebar and every view like a
terminal: rename, hide, minimize, resize, reorder, Focus and close all work. While it's
undocked, the terminal's taskbar leaves it out. **Dock in** its terminal, on the
window's right-click, closes the window and opens it in that terminal's pane again;
closing the window puts it back on the taskbar without opening it. Nothing runs in it;
it loads from its terminal, so once that terminal closes nothing new loads, and Dock in
shows disabled. The backends neither keep nor restore these windows yet
(`CompanionWindow` in `model/companion.ts`; the terminal registry skips them).

The pane reads everything from the backend's optional `companions` capability
(`model/companion.ts`): each terminal's plans and what its agent has shown, as terminals
and plans come and go; content loaded on demand; and a save that writes the user's
edits and notes into the plan file unless it changed since, in which case the pane
merges and saves again. Edits save once typing pauses and when focus leaves the plan.
Only the content-preview demo implements it, with sample agents in
`backend/demo/showcase/` that revise their plans over the file as the user left it and
remove the notes they apply. The runner doesn't implement it yet, so its terminals show
no taskbar; `docs/agent-workspace.md` ("Companion pane") says how it would. The editor
and its merge code load when a plan first opens.
Normal development and packaged builds keep their runner behavior.

### Debug panel

A small panel for reaching the app's runner states on demand. Press
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to open or close it; it takes the
keys before the terminal does.

It is available in development (`pnpm dev`, and `pnpm dev:web` or any Vite dev
server). A packaged app offers it only when launched with `--debug-panel` or with
`NOVADECK_DEBUG=1` in its environment; otherwise there is no panel, no shortcut,
and the main process registers no debug requests. (Plain `--debug` is not usable:
Electron rejects it as Node's retired debugger flag.) Buttons marked "(sim)" fake the
state; the others make it happen for real. The top line shows the runner id, the
connection state, runner restarts in the last minute, and the terminal count.

- **Startup:** boot again from the splash without reloading. "Splash" holds it
  until you press Escape; each "Error" fails the first attempt with that code, so
  transient errors retry on their own and the others wait for Retry or Quit.
  "Welcome dialog" opens the first-run dialog for connecting agents again.
- **Runner:** kill the runner process once, or four times 1.5 s apart to trip the
  crash-loop guard, or show a 5 s outage.
- **Selected terminal:** type `exit`, `exit 3`, `kill -9 $$`, `sleep 600`, or run a
  program named claude into the selected terminal's shell.
- **New terminals:** a shell that exits at once, one started in a missing folder,
  a simulated terminal limit, or thirty real shells.
- **Sessions:** start `sleep 600` here, then a fresh session, to see the sessions
  panel count it as running.

## Repository map

This is a TypeScript monorepo using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo.

| Package                | Responsibility                                                  |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `application/ui`       | React frontend built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide icons. |
| `application/runner`   | The runner: shells and metadata, served over WebSocket or port. |
| `application/protocol` | Shared Zod contracts and the `connectRunner` client for UIs.    |
| `application/host`     | Electron host that starts the runner and loads the packaged UI. |
| `scripts`              | Repository checks and automation.                               |

The UI runs real shells through the runner. Projects, sessions and their terminals
live in the runner's SQLite metadata, and each session saves its terminals' order and
layouts there too; preferences and sidebar settings are stored locally. Unit tests
and behaviour specs run on the demo adapter's sample data instead.

See the [terminal backend plan](docs/backend-plan.md) for the proposed runner
architecture and typed API.

The standalone backend now supports authenticated, real terminal processes and
persistent project/session metadata. The Electron host runs it in a utility process,
but the interface above is **not connected yet** and still uses mock data. See the
[backend API guide](docs/backend-api.md) for configuration, client examples, and
backend-only tests.

### Working on the UI

Source lives in `application/ui/src/`, grouped in layers:

| Location                                           | What belongs here                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/`                                             | Composition root: router, provider, backend selection, and the page sections.           |
| `app/ui-store.ts`                                  | The UI store: route, preferences, shell, rename, switcher, and its store subscriptions. |
| `app/selectors.ts`                                 | Pure reads over the stores that sections, commands, and keys share.                     |
| `app/commands/`                                    | Commands, key commands, and the navigator: plain functions over both stores.            |
| `app/controller/`                                  | React glue: context, selector hook, route sync, keyboard dispatcher, effects.           |
| `backend/`                                         | The UI-owned backend port and the shared terminal lifecycle registry.                   |
| `backend/demo/`                                    | The demo adapter for tests and specs: sample projects and simulated terminals.          |
| `backend/demo/showcase/`                           | The content preview's sample agents: plans, artifacts, and their simulated work.        |
| `backend/runner/`                                  | The runner adapter: connection, seed from the runner, saves, and the xterm surface.     |
| `model/`                                           | Pure domain: types, reducer, workspace store, seed, and layout rules in `layout/`.      |
| `model/companion.ts`                               | The contract for agents' plans and artifacts, and the plan note format.                 |
| `model/messages.ts`                                | The contract for agents' messages: threads, states, the pause, and a tab's count.       |
| `model/roster.ts`                                  | A session's terminals, their sidebar order, and their status.                           |
| `model/layout/workspace-layout.ts`                 | Where each terminal sits and how big it is in each view.                                |
| `terminals/`                                       | Terminal frame, tabs, rename state, and the recent-terminal switcher.                   |
| `terminals/companion/`                             | A terminal's taskbar and companion pane; the plan editor is in `plan-editor/`.          |
| `layouts/canvas/`, `grid/`, `focus/`               | View adapters and colocated library styles.                                             |
| `layouts/` (top level)                             | Helpers shared by views: view transitions, background gestures, visibility.             |
| `shell/`                                           | Header, rail, panels, zen dock, sidebar, and shell state transitions.                   |
| `sidebar/`, `projects/`, `preferences/`, `search/` | Feature components.                                                                     |
| `interaction/`                                     | Shortcut records, the keymap, and shared DOM focus/overlay contracts.                   |
| `ui-toolkit/`                                      | Reusable styled controls and direct Ark UI imports.                                     |
| `test/`                                            | Unit-test fixtures, a jsdom render helper, a command harness, and the port contract.    |
| `assets/`                                          | Static files referenced from CSS.                                                       |
| `styles.css`                                       | Theme tokens, global primitives, and shared workspace styles.                           |
| `specs/`                                           | Behaviour specs for the whole UI, run in a real browser.                                |

Imports point down the layers. `model/` imports nothing else, not even packages.
`backend/` builds on `model/` and uses React only for the port's types; adapters
may add `ui-toolkit/`. `interaction/` builds on `model/` and imports no packages;
features add `ui-toolkit/`; `terminals/` may use `sidebar/`; `layouts/` may use
`terminals/`; `shell/` may use `layouts/` and `projects/`. `app/` composes every
feature layer and `backend/`, and within it only `app/backend.ts` imports a
backend adapter. `app/commands/` has no direct React or package imports, though
routing still loads React Router at runtime: it builds on `model/`,
`interaction/keymap.ts`, `backend/port.ts`, the UI store, routing, selectors,
the Canvas handle type in `layouts/canvas/types.ts`, and the pure state modules
of `shell/` and `terminals/`. Vendor
libraries stay in their adapters: XYFlow in `layouts/canvas/`, React Grid Layout
in `layouts/grid/`, Allotment in `shell/`, dnd kit in `terminals/`, Ark UI in
`ui-toolkit/`, React Router in `app/` and `shell/`, and React DOM in
`layouts/transition.ts`, `main.tsx`, and `test/`, and the runner client and
xterm in `backend/runner/`. Other packages are denied
unless the test lists them: React and Lucide are allowed everywhere, while
backend adapters and test code may use any package. `test/` may import
`model/`, `backend/`, and what the command harness runs: `app/commands/`, the UI
store, routing, and the Canvas handle type. Hooks declare named contracts instead of
`ReturnType<typeof useHook>`. `src/architecture.test.ts` enforces these rules and
fails for a source file that belongs to no layer.

Navigation uses React Router with hash URLs in both the browser and Electron,
so links work with the packaged `file://` UI and static hosting. For example:

```text
#/projects/storefront/sessions/initial/canvas?terminal=05&panel=sessions
```

The path selects a project, workspace session, and view. Query parameters select
the terminal, sidebar panel, and dialog (`dialog=search` or `dialog=preferences`);
Preferences also accepts `section=shortcuts`. Back and Forward restore navigation
without discarding terminal drafts or output. Sidebar visibility, search text,
canvas gestures, and other temporary controls stay out of the URL.

Demo sessions use the stable ID `initial`; with the runner, projects, sessions,
and terminals use UUIDs the UI generates, so links survive a reload. A link to a
session that no longer exists falls back to that project's available session.
Unknown routes, missing terminals, and disabled views are replaced with a valid URL.

The page renders from two synchronous stores only. The workspace store in
`model/store.ts` holds the model: every session's roster, layout, and navigation
memory, changed through one pure reducer. The UI store in `app/ui-store.ts`
holds what the model does not own: the current route, preferences, the shell
state from `shell/shell-state.ts`, the rename in progress, the recent-terminal
switcher and each session's most-recent order, and the new-terminal highlight.
It starts over on reload apart from preferences and the collapsed sidebar, which
store subscriptions persist. Another subscription saves the active session's
windowed view from the workspace store, and a new App seeds sessions with it. `WorkspaceProvider` creates
the backend, both stores, the navigator, and the commands once per App, in a
pure initializer, and shares them through context; it receives the page as
children, so a URL change re-renders only the provider.

The URL owns current navigation; the workspace model remembers each session's
last selection. The navigator in `app/commands/navigator.ts` commits a
destination's workspace actions and route to the stores before it asks the
router to navigate, so a command's changes and its URL render together. The
route sync in `app/controller/useRouteSync.ts` is the one place the URL enters
the stores: in a layout effect it reconciles Back, Forward, typed URLs, and
preference changes against the latest model and replaces a URL that names
something unavailable. A session change starts the shell's presentation over in
the same commit, through a store subscription, and Back or Forward does the same
from route sync, so a view that mounts next already sees it.

Commands in `app/commands/` are the operations the pointer UI and the keyboard
share. They are plain functions that read the latest stores when they run, so
several in one event retain one another's changes; construct an action from
command-time state when it depends on a counter or the current selection. They
reach the page (focus, view transitions, timers, the clock, ids) only through the
`CommandEffects` that `app/controller/effects.ts` supplies, and tests pass their
own. Address updates by project and session IDs so delayed callbacks affect
their original session or become a no-op after it is removed: layout callbacks
take the target their view rendered with, because Canvas saves its geometry when
it unmounts after a session switch.

Keyboard shortcuts are data. `interaction/keymap.ts` lists every binding by
layer and routes a key from its input, the kind of element it was pressed on,
and the store state, without touching the DOM; `app/commands/keys.ts` maps each
command id onto the commands, and `app/controller/useKeyboard.ts` listens on
window in the capture and bubble phases of keydown, and for keyup and blur.
Preferences renders its shortcut table from `shortcutGroups`. Canvas keeps its
own zoom keys.

Sections in `app/` subscribe to just what they render with `useWorkspaceState`
and `useUiState`, built on `useStoreSelector`, and share selectors from
`app/selectors.ts`. Each terminal frame and sidebar tab selects by its own
terminal, so a rename keystroke re-renders only that tab and frame. A Canvas
layout save re-renders the stage section, Canvas, and the terminals on it, but not
the header, sidebar, tabs, or overlays. Effects that must follow a commit, such as
saving a rename left behind, live in `app/controller/useWorkspaceEffects.ts`.
Feature components outside `app/` take props.

Terminal metadata and saved layouts live in the workspace model. Everything
else about a terminal belongs to a backend behind the port in `backend/port.ts`:
it supplies the starting workspace seed, allocates new terminals synchronously,
sees every store commit before listeners run, and renders the content inside
each terminal frame. A surface marks the element that takes typed input with
`data-terminal-input`, so shortcuts treat it as terminal input. The demo adapter
keeps drafts, output, and scroll offsets per terminal with one subscription
each, so output does not trigger workspace-wide renders. A terminal's
presentation can unmount during view or session changes without losing that
state; closing the terminal removes it. `backend/registry.ts` provides this
lifecycle for any adapter. An adapter opts into the port contract suite by
calling `describeBackendContract` from `test/backend-contract.tsx` in a
colocated `contract.test.ts`, with a probe of what it holds and the I/O it
started, and a driver when it has `start`. `App` reads a `createBackend` factory
once at mount, and `app/backend.ts` chooses the default: the demo under tests, and
a runner connection in every build. A backend that must connect first supplies a
`ConnectBackend`; `app/BackendGate.tsx` shows a splash until it resolves with the
seed loaded, or a card saying what failed with a Retry button, and closes it on unmount.

A backend reports changes of its own, such as a process exiting or failing to
start, through the optional `start`. It runs from an effect after mount and
receives a sink that commits each call as one store transaction, like a UI
command; the sink ignores stale targets and anything sent after stop. It reports
status and the foreground process, which picks the terminal's icon and counts it as
running, and closes a terminal whose shell exited cleanly. The frame labels an
exited, killed, or failed terminal. Closing a terminal a program runs in asks first:
the `close` command records the pending close in the UI store, and the dialog in
`terminals/CloseTerminalDialog.tsx` answers with `confirmClose` or `cancelClose`. A backend may also
expose its connection state, which the footer shows, and a folder picker, which
enables "Open folder…".

The runner adapter creates projects, sessions, and terminals on the runner as their
commits arrive, and saves each changed session after a short pause and on
`pagehide`. On load it restores saved sessions, most recently visited first, and adds
running terminals the save did not know. A terminal the runner no longer has, after
a runner restart or a relaunch, gets a fresh shell in place with the same id, name
and layout once its session is on screen, or at once when it has an agent to resume;
more than three runner restarts in a minute stop that, and each terminal then waits
for Enter. An exited, killed, or
failed terminal shows "Press Enter to restart", which starts a fresh shell in the
same tile. While the runner is away, surfaces dim and refuse input.

XYFlow owns live Canvas gestures; save geometry and camera state when a gesture
ends or the view unmounts. Grid, Canvas, Preferences, and search load on demand.
Keep vendor-specific types and CSS inside their adapters, and use
application-owned types for saved layouts.

Keep direct Ark UI imports in `ui-toolkit/`; features own their content and state.
Use Tailwind utilities for ordinary component styling. See [CODING.md](CODING.md)
for broader conventions.

### UI behaviour specs

`src/specs/` describes the UI the way a person uses it and guards the UX while
the implementation changes. Each spec renders the whole app in headless Chromium
with real CSS, layout, pointer, and keyboard input. The main behaviour project
enables reduced motion; the smaller motion project exercises ordinary transitions.
Specs find elements by accessible role, name, or text, and assert only what a
person can observe: what is visible, focused, selected, or where it sits on
screen. They never import components, mock app modules, or select by CSS class,
so a refactor that keeps the UI intact keeps them green. `specs/support/` holds
the shared vocabulary (for example `openWorkspace`, `terminal`, `chooseView`);
when markup changes on purpose, update it there. If a behaviour can't be reached
through accessible markup, improve the markup rather than adding test IDs.

Install the browser once with `pnpm --filter @novadeck/ui exec playwright install chromium`.
Run a single spec with `pnpm --filter @novadeck/ui exec vitest run --project behaviour src/specs/canvas.spec.tsx`,
or `--project unit` for reducer invariants, terminal lifecycle, layout rules,
stores, commands, keymap routing, render scope, architecture rules, and build
checks in colocated `*.test.ts` files. Files in `src/specs/` keep
the `*.spec.tsx` suffix. Use `--project motion` for transition behavior. The build
checks validate both entry assets and deferred chunks with relative packaged paths.

## Configuration

For standalone UI/runner configuration, copy the environment templates:

```sh
cp application/ui/example.env application/ui/.env
cp application/runner/example.env application/runner/.env
```

- UI: `VITE_API_URL` sets, at build time, the API origin that the Content Security
  Policy permits; by default only the same origin. The UI does not call the API yet.
- Browser UI: `VITE_NOVADECK_RUNNER_URL` (a `ws:` or `wss:` URL ending in `/api/rpc`)
  and `VITE_NOVADECK_RUNNER_TOKEN` name the runner a browser build connects to; the
  CSP permits that origin. The desktop app ignores them and uses its own runner.

  > **Warning:** a browser build made with `VITE_NOVADECK_RUNNER_TOKEN` embeds the
  > token in its JavaScript. Anyone who can load that bundle can run shells on the
  > runner as its user. Keep such builds private: never deploy or share them.

- Runner: `HOST`, `PORT`, and `CORS_ORIGINS` control the listener and allowed frontend origins.
- Terminal API: `NOVADECK_TOKEN` enables authenticated WebSocket RPC;
  `NOVADECK_DATABASE` optionally selects the SQLite metadata file. Without a token,
  only the existing HTTP status API is available.
- Electron: the host runs the runner in a utility process and hands each window a
  MessagePort through a sandboxed preload bridge. It also serves the status endpoint
  on a local, OS-selected port. Package `.env` files are not used.

For a separately hosted frontend, set `VITE_API_URL` to the public HTTPS API URL
before building and add the frontend origin to `CORS_ORIGINS`. The generated
Content Security Policy permits the configured API origin. Local `.env` files
are ignored; never commit credentials.

## Validation

```sh
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

Use package filters for focused checks, for example `pnpm exec turbo run test --filter=@novadeck/ui`,
which builds what the tests need first. `pnpm test` runs one package's tests at a time:
the UI's browser tests and the runner's real-PTY tests are timing-sensitive, and running
them together starved the smaller CI runners enough to time out.
Tests use Vitest: UI behaviour specs run in Vitest Browser Mode on Chromium, and
MSW covers HTTP behavior. The PR workflows run formatting, lint, typechecking,
builds, and PR metadata checks on Linux. The Test jobs run all package and repository
tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows, including for draft PRs. Each runs UI tests in
Chromium alongside backend API, real PTY, and built-CLI tests. The required `Test`
check passes only when the entire Quality matrix succeeds. PRs marked ready for review package
and smoke-test the app on Linux, macOS, and Windows using the same workflow as
releases. Draft PRs skip packaging; PR checks never create tags or publish releases.
Quality checks run on PR opening, reopening, and commits. Marking a draft PR ready
starts only the Release workflow, which reuses the matching Quality result before
packaging and smoke testing. Release preparation, tagging, and publishing are
disabled for PR runs.

## Packaging and releases

```sh
pnpm package:linux
pnpm package:mac
pnpm package:win
```

Artifacts go to `application/host/release/`: a Linux x64 AppImage, a macOS
universal ZIP, or a Windows x64 portable executable. Builds are unsigned, so
Gatekeeper or SmartScreen may warn. The application ID is `dev.mzpk.novadeck`.

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) publishes immutable GitHub
prereleases from qualifying changes on `main`, with notes, checksums, and native
packages. It smoke-tests each packaged application before upload. Conventional
Commits determine release eligibility; versions are currently limited to patch
increments. Documentation-only changes do not trigger a release. See
[.release-it.json](.release-it.json) for the release configuration.

Promote tested binaries on GitHub Releases by clearing **Set as a pre-release**
and selecting **Set as the latest release**; no rebuild is needed. For an
interrupted release, inspect the latest workflow first. An unpublished draft or
orphaned version tag must be cleaned up before rerunning the latest release
workflow; published immutable releases must remain intact.
